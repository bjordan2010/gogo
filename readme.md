Gogo is my 2nd attempt at a Go (weiqi, baduk) game in Go (lang).  Borrowed some Shiny example code for a good start.

## Todo List
- [x] Figure out how to use command line options to set board size and scale (19,18 and 9,35) May improve later but it works.
- [x] Change white to right click (3) and remove stone to middle click (2)
- [x] Do more manual testing on 9x9 to understand code
- [ ] Add some written tests to understand shiny code
- [ ] Fix cmd+q not having focus to close even after mouse click
- [ ] Use these keys to
- cmd+n to new game 19x19
- cmd+m to new game 9x9
- cmd+o to resign as white
- cmd+p to resign as black
- cmd+b to pass as black
- cmd+w to pass as white
- [ ] Add coordinates
- [ ] Add indicator to last move for each color
- [ ] Add sound for stone placement
- [ ] Upgrade to 1.17
- [ ] Implement Go rules:
- Capturing stones
- Disallow placing new stone if stone already in place
- Implement passing
- Implement resigning
- Implement scoring after consecutive passes
- Add respecting ko
- [ ] Load board from sgf file
- [ ] Save board to sgf file
- [ ] Create dumb AI
- [ ] Implement review with KataGo
